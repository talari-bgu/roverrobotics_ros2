This custom created package implements the ability to switch between three LOAs:
1. Manual teleoperation - Operator has absolute control over the robot navigation using a controller.
2. Assisted teleoperation - Operator has control over the robot however robot can interfere and stops to avoid collision.
3. Autonomous navigation - Robot drives itself.

TODO Also this package implement rviz2 interface to change the LOAs.
